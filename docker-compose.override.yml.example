# 2. Uncomment the services you want to debug
# 3. Run: docker-compose up -d
# 4. Access services directly at http://localhost:300X/health
# 5. Remember to remove docker-compose.override.yml when done debugging

# Security Note:
# - Only use override files in development environments
# - Never commit docker-compose.override.yml to version control
# - The override file is already added to .gitignore
